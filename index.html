                <p>
                    Welcome to Therapists' Hut—a resource space created by a therapist, for therapists.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If you're a trainee or newly qualified practitioner, you may have noticed something: while our training programs provide excellent grounding in theory and therapeutic practice, they sometimes leave us feeling overwhelmed by the practical realities of setting up and running a practice. Questions about managing finances, organizing client records, creating systems, and navigating the day-to-day logistics can feel daunting.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I created this website to share how I found my way through these challenges. My hope is that by documenting the systems I've developed and the tools I've created, I can offer you a landing place—somewhere to start forming your own ideas and approaches. You don't need to follow my path exactly, but perhaps seeing how one person navigated these waters will make your own journey feel more manageable.
                </p>

                <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>

                </p>
                <ul>

                    Everything shared here is offered in a person-centred spirit—not as prescriptive rules, but as possibilities for you to consider, adapt, or reimagine in ways that fit your own unique practice and way of being as a therapist.
                </p>

        <section id="about" class="tab-content">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <p>
                    My journey to becoming a psychotherapist began in what might seem like an unlikely place—the world of software engineering and agile project management. For over ten years, I worked as a software engineer and agile scrum master in leading financial institutions, where I developed strong analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a deep understanding of how systems work.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    While this career was intellectually rewarding, I felt drawn to work that engaged more directly with people and their inner worlds. This led me to begin training at the Metanoia Institute, where I spent nine years completing my MSc in Contemporary Person Centred Psychotherapy. This extensive training period allowed me to deeply immerse myself in the theory and practice of person-centred therapy, while also integrating my previous experiences in ways I hadn't anticipated.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Bringing Two Worlds Together</h3>
                <p>
                    My background in technology has influenced my therapeutic work in unexpected ways. Throughout my training, I found myself creating visualizations of person-centred psychotherapy concepts—visual representations that help make abstract theoretical ideas more concrete and accessible. Many of my peers and supervisors found these visualizations helpful for teaching students and even for use in conversations with clients.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    These diagrams and visual tools became a way of bridging my two professional worlds: using systematic thinking and visual design to illuminate the depth and complexity of therapeutic theory. You'll find many of these visualizations in the Visualization section of this website.
                </p>
                
                <h3>My Therapeutic Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    My practice is grounded in person-centred theory, which emphasizes the actualizing tendency present in all of us—the innate drive toward growth, healing, and fulfilling our potential. I work to create a therapeutic relationship characterized by genuineness, unconditional positive regard, and empathic understanding, trusting in each person's capacity for self-direction and self-understanding.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This same person-centred philosophy shapes how I approach sharing resources through this website. During my training and early years of practice, I experienced firsthand how overwhelming it can be to navigate the practical aspects of starting a therapy practice. Creating Therapists' Hut is my way of extending the person-centred values of support and non-directive guidance to fellow therapists finding their own way.
