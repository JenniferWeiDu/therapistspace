                <p>
                    Welcome to Therapists Space, a resource space created by a therapist, for therapists.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If you're a trainee or newly qualified practitioner, you may have noticed something: while our training programs provide excellent grounding in theory and therapeutic practice, they sometimes leave us feeling overwhelmed by the practical realities of setting up and running a practice. Questions about managing finances, organizing client records, creating systems, and navigating the day-to-day logistics can feel daunting.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I created this website to share how I found my way through these challenges. My hope is that by documenting the systems I've developed and the tools I've created, I can offer you a landing place, somewhere to start forming your own ideas and approaches. You don't need to follow my path exactly, but perhaps seeing how one person navigated these waters will make your own journey feel more manageable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you are a client or interested in learning more about my therapeutic practice, please visit my psychotherapy <a href="https://jenniferweidu.github.io/psychotherapy/" target="_blank">website</a> for clients.

                <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>
                <p>
                    This website offers practical resources across several areas:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>About Me:</strong> My journey from software engineering to psychotherapy and my person-centred approach</li>
                    <li><strong>Website:</strong> Step-by-step guidance for creating your own professional therapy website using GitHub and AI tools</li>

                    <li><strong>Research & Visualizations:</strong> My dissertation on boundaries and visual representations of person-centred concepts including the 7 Stages of Process, Power in Relationships, the 6 Conditions, and Personal Depth</li>
                    <li><strong>Community:</strong> Links to communities and resources I've found valuable in my therapeutic journey</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact:</strong> Ways to get in touch if you have questions or want to connect</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Everything shared here is offered in a person-centred spirit, not as prescriptive rules, but as possibilities for you to consider, adapt, or reimagine in ways that fit your own unique practice and way of being as a therapist.
                </p>

        <section id="about" class="tab-content">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <p>
                    My journey to becoming a psychotherapist began in what might seem like an unlikely place: the world of software engineering and agile project management. For over ten years, I worked as a software engineer and agile scrum master in leading financial institutions, where I developed strong analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a deep understanding of how systems work.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    While this career was intellectually rewarding, I felt drawn to work that engaged more directly with people and their inner worlds. This led me to begin training at the Metanoia Institute, where I spent nine years completing my MSc in Contemporary Person Centred Psychotherapy. This extensive training period allowed me to deeply immerse myself in the theory and practice of person-centred therapy, while also integrating my previous experiences in ways I hadn't anticipated.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Bringing Two Worlds Together</h3>
                <p>
                    My background in technology has influenced my therapeutic work in unexpected ways. Throughout my training, I found myself creating visualizations of person-centred psychotherapy concepts, visual representations that help make abstract theoretical ideas more concrete and accessible. Many of my peers and supervisors found these visualizations helpful for teaching students and even for use in conversations with clients.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    These diagrams and visual tools became a way of bridging my two professional worlds: using systematic thinking and visual design to illuminate the depth and complexity of therapeutic theory. You'll find many of these visualizations in the Research & Visualizations section of this website.
                </p>
                
                <h3>My Therapeutic Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    My practice is grounded in person-centred theory, which emphasizes the actualizing tendency present in all of us, the innate drive toward growth, healing, and fulfilling our potential. I work to create a therapeutic relationship characterized by genuineness, unconditional positive regard, and empathic understanding, trusting in each person's capacity for self-direction and self-understanding.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This same person-centred philosophy shapes how I approach sharing resources through this website. During my training and early years of practice, I experienced firsthand how overwhelming it can be to navigate the practical aspects of starting a therapy practice. Creating Therapists Space is my way of extending the person-centred values of support and non-directive guidance to fellow therapists finding their own way.

            <h2>Website</h2>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    I decided to create my website by myself with assistance from AI. I checked various hosting services, their costs, as well as the support they offered. In the end, I decided to choose GitHub to host my static psychotherapy website, as it's free of charge. GitHub is a leading version control platform within the software engineering world, and its GitHub Copilot can help me create and update my website without needing to go into the code level to make changes myself. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If you're a student, you also get free access to GitHub Copilot AI Pro as well as free domain service linked with GitHub (with student status verified). This makes it an even more attractive option for trainees who are setting up their first professional website.
                </p>

                <h3>Steps to Create Your Website</h3>
                <p>
                    <em>Note: These instructions are based on my experience using a Windows 11 system. The process may vary slightly on Mac or Linux.</em>

                    <h4>Quick Navigation</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#step1">1. Register with GitHub and Create a Repository</a></li>

                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4 id="step1">1. Register with GitHub and Create a Repository</h4>
                <p>
                    Start by creating a free account at <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>. Once you're logged in, create a new repository by clicking the "+" icon in the top right corner and selecting "New repository". Give it a meaningful name (for example, "psychotherapy-website"). Make sure to check the box to initialize with a README file. This repository will store all your website files and GitHub will automatically host it for free using GitHub Pages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you are a student, you can get free access to GitHub Copilot Pro and free domain registration through the GitHub Student Developer Pack. Visit <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank">GitHub Education</a> and click "Get your pack" to verify your student status. You'll need to provide proof of enrollment (such as a school-issued email address or documentation). Once verified, you'll have access to premium features that normally require payment.
                </p>

                <h4 id="step2">2. Download and Install Git Bash</h4>
                <p>
                    Git Bash is a tool that allows you to interact with GitHub from your computer. Download it from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">git-scm.com</a> and follow the installation wizard. You can use the default settings during installation. Git Bash will enable you to clone (download) your repository to your local machine and later push (upload) your changes back to GitHub.
                </p>

                <h4 id="step3">3. Download and Install Visual Studio Code</h4>
                <p>
                    Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, powerful code editor where you'll work on your website. Download it from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">code.visualstudio.com</a>. After installation, you'll also want to install the GitHub Copilot extension from the Extensions marketplace within VS Code. This AI assistant will help you create and modify your website content without needing to learn coding from scratch.
                </p>

                <h4 id="step4">4. Clone Your Repository and Create Your Website</h4>
                <p>
                    Open VS Code and use the terminal (you can open it from the menu: Terminal → New Terminal). Use the command <code>git clone [your-repository-url]</code> to download your repository to your computer. You can find your repository URL on your GitHub repository page by clicking the green "Code" button. Once cloned, open the folder in VS Code. Now you can ask GitHub Copilot to help you create your website by describing what you want. For example, "Create a simple professional psychotherapy website with an about page and contact form."
                </p>

                <h4 id="step5">5. Install Live Server and Preview Locally</h4>
                <p>
                    In VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension from the Extensions marketplace. This allows you to preview your website locally on your computer before publishing it. Right-click on your HTML file and select "Open with Live Server" to see your website in a browser. Make changes, review them in real-time, and iterate until you're happy with how everything looks. When satisfied, use Git commands to commit your changes (<code>git add .</code>, <code>git commit -m "Initial website"</code>) and push them to GitHub (<code>git push</code>).
                </p>

                <h4 id="step6">6. Publish Your Website with GitHub Pages</h4>
                <p>
                    Once you've pushed your website files to GitHub, it's time to make your site publicly accessible. Go to your repository on GitHub.com and click on the "Settings" tab. In the left sidebar, find and click on "Pages" under the "Code and automation" section. Under "Source", select the branch you want to publish (usually "main" or "master"), and select the root folder ("/") as the source. Click "Save". GitHub will process your site, and within a few minutes, you'll see a message saying "Your site is live at https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/". Click on that URL to see your live website!
                </p>

                <h4 id="step7">7. Iterate and Improve</h4>
                <p>
                    Website creation is an iterative process. Continue making improvements by asking GitHub Copilot to help you add new sections, adjust styling, or fix issues. Always preview changes locally with Live Server first, and when you're satisfied, commit and push your updates to GitHub. Your website will automatically update on GitHub Pages each time you push new changes. Over time, you'll build exactly the professional presence you want, with AI assistance every step of the way.
                </p>

                <h3>Financial Management for Therapists</h3>
                <p>
                    Managing the financial aspects of your practice is essential for sustainability.
                    Here you'll find resources and tools to help you track income, expenses, and
                    maintain healthy financial practices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will be gradually adding information about the following key areas:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Session Tracking:</strong> Keep accurate records of client sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>Income Management:</strong> Monitor your earnings and payment schedules</li>
                    <li><strong>Expense Tracking:</strong> Record and categorize business expenses</li>
                    <li><strong>Tax Preparation:</strong> Resources for tax season and quarterly reporting</li>
                    <li><strong>Invoicing:</strong> Templates and tools for professional invoicing</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Business Account</h3>
                <p>
                    When starting my practice, I decided to register a business account with <a href="https://www.mettle.co.uk/" target="_blank">Mettle NatWest</a> for Sole Trader. This choice was based on several practical considerations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Free access to FreeAgent:</strong> Mettle provides complimentary use of FreeAgent accounting software, which is fully compliant with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-tax-digital" target="_blank">HMRC's Making Tax Digital</a> requirement for quarterly tax reporting through digital platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peer recommendations:</strong> Several practitioners I know use and recommend Mettle, which gave me confidence it would be a reliable starting point for managing practice finances.</li>
                    <li><strong>No fees:</strong> The account is free to use, which helps keep overhead costs low when you're establishing your practice.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I submitted my application in January 2026 and was informed that the estimated processing time would be approximately 10 working days.

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    This page contains my research work and a collection of visualizations that emerged during my nine-year MSc Person-Centred training journey at Metanoia Institute (2017–2026). These creations became a way for me to connect deeply with complex therapeutic concepts and translate them into accessible, meaningful forms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond sharing this work with fellow trainees, tutors, and therapists, I want to share something perhaps more valuable: the story of how these came to be. My hope is that by offering a glimpse into my creative process, I might invite you (as therapists and practitioners) to discover your own ways of exploring, visualizing, and connecting with your own creativity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most powerful insights and visualizations are not those borrowed from others, but those that arise organically from our own understanding and experience. This truth applies equally to our work with clients and to our relationships with children, where authentic meaning comes from within, not from external templates.
                </p>

                        My MSc dissertation explores the concept of boundaries within person-centred therapeutic practice. This research examines how boundaries function in the therapeutic relationship while remaining congruent with person-centred principles.

                                This is a view from under the sea. When I look up, I can see the sunlight of this world above the surface. Going deeper down, I access the dark valleys with lava underneath. When the whole world is trying to teach me skills to go up, to move closer to the presentational level of the world we live in, there is an intuition in my heart calling me to go down.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is the black hole that sucks away my life energy. This is the flame that burns my body every time I get close. I don't know what's down there, but I somehow know it holds the truth of my life. So I let go of all the safety buoyancy. I was burned many, many times.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And one day, I suddenly understood. These valleys are my existential valleys. These flames are agony. To be able to stay with this pain without trying to deny, distort, or run away, that is what presence really means.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When presence reaches deep, it is like roots growing into our core self, where energy and creativity can be channeled from personal depth all the way to the surface world, potentially reaching our clients and the people around us.
