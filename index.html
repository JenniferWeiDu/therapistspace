                <p>
                    Welcome to Therapists' Hut—a resource space created by a therapist, for therapists.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If you're a trainee or newly qualified practitioner, you may have noticed something: while our training programs provide excellent grounding in theory and therapeutic practice, they sometimes leave us feeling overwhelmed by the practical realities of setting up and running a practice. Questions about managing finances, organizing client records, creating systems, and navigating the day-to-day logistics can feel daunting.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I created this website to share how I found my way through these challenges. My hope is that by documenting the systems I've developed and the tools I've created, I can offer you a landing place—somewhere to start forming your own ideas and approaches. You don't need to follow my path exactly, but perhaps seeing how one person navigated these waters will make your own journey feel more manageable.
                </p>

                <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>
                <p>
                    This website offers practical resources across several areas:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Website:</strong> Information about building your professional presence online</li>
                    <li><strong>Accounting:</strong> Practical systems for managing the financial aspects of your practice</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Visual representations of person-centred psychotherapy concepts that can be useful for teaching, learning, and client work</li>
                    <li><strong>About Me:</strong> My journey from software engineering to psychotherapy</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact:</strong> Ways to get in touch if you have questions or want to connect</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Everything shared here is offered in a person-centred spirit—not as prescriptive rules, but as possibilities for you to consider, adapt, or reimagine in ways that fit your own unique practice and way of being as a therapist.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="about" class="tab-content">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <p>
                    My journey to becoming a psychotherapist began in what might seem like an unlikely place—the world of software engineering and agile project management. For over ten years, I worked as a software engineer and agile scrum master in leading financial institutions, where I developed strong analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a deep understanding of how systems work.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    While this career was intellectually rewarding, I felt drawn to work that engaged more directly with people and their inner worlds. This led me to begin training at the Metanoia Institute, where I spent nine years completing my MSc in Contemporary Person Centred Psychotherapy. This extensive training period allowed me to deeply immerse myself in the theory and practice of person-centred therapy, while also integrating my previous experiences in ways I hadn't anticipated.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Bringing Two Worlds Together</h3>
                <p>
                    My background in technology has influenced my therapeutic work in unexpected ways. Throughout my training, I found myself creating visualizations of person-centred psychotherapy concepts—visual representations that help make abstract theoretical ideas more concrete and accessible. Many of my peers and supervisors found these visualizations helpful for teaching students and even for use in conversations with clients.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    These diagrams and visual tools became a way of bridging my two professional worlds: using systematic thinking and visual design to illuminate the depth and complexity of therapeutic theory. You'll find many of these visualizations in the Visualization section of this website.
                </p>
                
                <h3>My Therapeutic Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    My practice is grounded in person-centred theory, which emphasizes the actualizing tendency present in all of us—the innate drive toward growth, healing, and fulfilling our potential. I work to create a therapeutic relationship characterized by genuineness, unconditional positive regard, and empathic understanding, trusting in each person's capacity for self-direction and self-understanding.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This same person-centred philosophy shapes how I approach sharing resources through this website. During my training and early years of practice, I experienced firsthand how overwhelming it can be to navigate the practical aspects of starting a therapy practice. Creating Therapists' Hut is my way of extending the person-centred values of support and non-directive guidance to fellow therapists finding their own way.

            <h2>Website</h2>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    I decided to create my website by myself with assistance from AI. I checked various hosting services, their costs, as well as the support they offered. In the end, I decided to choose GitHub to host my static psychotherapy website—it's free of charge. GitHub is a leading version control platform within the software engineering world, and its GitHub Copilot can help me create and update my website without needing to go into the code level to make changes myself. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If you're a student, you also get free access to GitHub Copilot AI Pro as well as free domain service linked with GitHub (with student status verified). This makes it an even more attractive option for trainees who are setting up their first professional website.
                </p>

                <h3>Steps to Create Your Website</h3>
                <p>
                    <em>Note: These instructions are based on my experience using a Windows 11 system. The process may vary slightly on Mac or Linux.</em>

                    <h4>Quick Navigation</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#step1">1. Register with GitHub and Create a Repository</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#step2">2. Download and Install Git Bash</a></li>

                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4 id="step1">1. Register with GitHub and Create a Repository</h4>
                <p>
                    Start by creating a free account at <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>. Once you're logged in, create a new repository by clicking the "+" icon in the top right corner and selecting "New repository". Give it a meaningful name (for example, "psychotherapy-website"). Make sure to check the box to initialize with a README file. This repository will store all your website files and GitHub will automatically host it for free using GitHub Pages.
                </p>

                <h4 id="step2">2. Download and Install Git Bash</h4>
                <p>
                    Git Bash is a tool that allows you to interact with GitHub from your computer. Download it from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">git-scm.com</a> and follow the installation wizard. You can use the default settings during installation. Git Bash will enable you to clone (download) your repository to your local machine and later push (upload) your changes back to GitHub.
                </p>

                <h4 id="step3">3. Download and Install Visual Studio Code</h4>
                <p>
                    Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, powerful code editor where you'll work on your website. Download it from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">code.visualstudio.com</a>. After installation, you'll also want to install the GitHub Copilot extension from the Extensions marketplace within VS Code. This AI assistant will help you create and modify your website content without needing to learn coding from scratch.
                </p>

                <h4 id="step4">4. Clone Your Repository and Create Your Website</h4>
                <p>
                    Open VS Code and use the terminal (you can open it from the menu: Terminal → New Terminal). Use the command <code>git clone [your-repository-url]</code> to download your repository to your computer. You can find your repository URL on your GitHub repository page by clicking the green "Code" button. Once cloned, open the folder in VS Code. Now you can ask GitHub Copilot to help you create your website by describing what you want—for example, "Create a simple professional psychotherapy website with an about page and contact form."
                </p>

                <h4 id="step5">5. Install Live Server and Preview Locally</h4>
                <p>
                    In VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension from the Extensions marketplace. This allows you to preview your website locally on your computer before publishing it. Right-click on your HTML file and select "Open with Live Server" to see your website in a browser. Make changes, review them in real-time, and iterate until you're happy with how everything looks. When satisfied, use Git commands to commit your changes (<code>git add .</code>, <code>git commit -m "Initial website"</code>) and push them to GitHub (<code>git push</code>).
                </p>

                <h4 id="step6">6. Publish Your Website with GitHub Pages</h4>
                <p>
                    Once you've pushed your website files to GitHub, it's time to make your site publicly accessible. Go to your repository on GitHub.com and click on the "Settings" tab. In the left sidebar, find and click on "Pages" under the "Code and automation" section. Under "Source", select the branch you want to publish (usually "main" or "master"), and select the root folder ("/") as the source. Click "Save". GitHub will process your site, and within a few minutes, you'll see a message saying "Your site is live at https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/". Click on that URL to see your live website!
                </p>

                <h4 id="step7">7. Iterate and Improve</h4>
                <p>
                    Website creation is an iterative process. Continue making improvements—ask GitHub Copilot to help you add new sections, adjust styling, or fix issues. Always preview changes locally with Live Server first, and when you're satisfied, commit and push your updates to GitHub. Your website will automatically update on GitHub Pages each time you push new changes. Over time, you'll build exactly the professional presence you want, with AI assistance every step of the way.
